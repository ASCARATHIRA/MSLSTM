# MSLSTM: A Multi-Scale Long Short-Term Memory Model

### Introduction
We extract statistical features and build models to identify anomalous bgp traffic based on several typical anomaly event data sets. 
This package includes multi-scale LSTM, attention based multi-scale LSTM, hierarchy attention based multi-scale LSTM as well as baselines (1-layer LSTM, 2-Layer LSTM, RNN and traditional machine learning methods).
### Dependencies
numpy,
PyWavelets,
scikit-leran,
tensorflow,
matplotlib,
Keras (Tensorflow backend).

### Cite
The original BGP data set is from RIPE Network Coordination Center: [RIPE RIS raw data] (https://www.ripe.net/analyse/internet-measurements/routing-information-service-ris/ris-raw-data)
